       "      <td>(Reuters) - An estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Philippines' Duterte takes aim at graft agency head for query on his wealth</th>\n",
       "      <td>MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday vowed to file an impeachment complaint against the head of the country s anti-graft body after she launched an inquiry into allegations that he has billions of pesos in undeclared funds in bank accounts. The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.</td>\n",

       "      <th>RNC’s Hilariously Delusional Election Model Predicts Obama Might Vote Trump</th>\n",
       "      <td>The Republican Party is not well   we know it and they know it.After getting roasted in the last general election, the Republican Party conducted a fittingly named  autopsy  on what would need to change before 2016 in order for the party to successfully compete with Democrats. The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</td>\n",

       "      <td>You can t be black and support President Trump. The intolerant left simply won t allow it Boxing legend George Foreman has had about enough of the disrespect of the United States he s seeing in some professional athletes, particularly Colin Kaepernick and Kevin Durant.In an interview on the Offended America Podcast on Monday, the 68-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion blasted the national anthem protests and shunning of the White House by the likes of Kaepernick and Durant, suggesting they were born out of ignorance about just how privileged we are to live in this great country.As for Durant s announcement that he would not attend the White House if his Golden State Warriors are invited because he doesn t  respect who s in office right now,  Foreman said he and the others protesting Trump were just  sore losers. In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially. He s part of writing those checks so I could be back on the wealthy side again,  said Foreman. -Daily WireFox and Friends   Shortly after his inauguration, George Foreman offered some wise words of advice for his friend Donald J. Trump: The two-time world heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman sounded off on President Trump, saying he has to keep fighting in order to continue his  winning  streak.Foreman compared Trump s battles with the many opposition groups to the numerous boxing matches he participated in over the years. When you re in something like this, you just have to fight,  he said.Watch:He advised Trump not to listen to his detractors and stay on message, saying that while  in the ring  he would not listen to the  boos  from the crowd until he was home watching the match on tape.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump has been in office for several months now, and he still hasn t figured out the proper way to respond to a terrorist attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       "      <th>NASA and FEMA Rehearse for the Unthinkable: An Asteroid Strike on Los Angeles - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Imagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles. The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Comments Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?</td>\n",

       "      <th>‘Not Our President’: Protests Spread After Donald Trump’s Election - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Thousands of people across the country marched, shut down highways, burned effigies and shouted angry slogans on Wednesday night to protest the election of Donald J. Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”</td>\n",

       "      <th>Trump has been playing a part, will become more presidential: adviser</th>\n",
       "      <td>HOLLYWOOD, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top advisers to Donald Trump assured Republican Party leaders on Thursday that the New York billionaire would adopt a more presidential demeanor soon, to temper the image projected during his campaign so far. Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Czech election winner Babis to seek minority government</th>\n",
       "      <td>LANY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Czech election winner Andrej Babis will attempt to form a minority government after being shunned by other parties, Babis said on Tuesday after meeting the president. The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term.</td>\n",

I would say yes because we all know what happens after someone gets rich off an idea like this doesn t go away easily or quickly…..and neither should their lies……..hmmm …...the truth always comes back around eventually don´t ya love conspiracy theories??!!

       "      <th>BREAKING: TSA AGENT SEXUALLY MOLESTS STUDENT AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT</th>\n",
       "      <td>This is so scary for anyone out there but especially for parents who fly their kids to different places alone. This TSA agent took advantage of this young girl who was probably scared to death. Horrible!A college student was sexually molested at LaGuardia Airport by a uniformed TSA agent who demanded she go into a bathroom with him after she got off a flight so she could be searched, sources told The Post.The 22-year-old victim, who is Korean, had gotten off the plane from Salt Lake City around 8 p.m. Tuesday when the agent approached her on the third floor of Terminal B. He  lured  her into the bathroom by demanding she be searched and then molested her, the sources said. The woman filed a complaint with cops, and witnesses at a money exchange booth were able to help identify the sex fiend. The alleged assailant   a 5-foot-9, heavyset man wearing a TSA uniform   has been arrested and charged with sexual abuse, the sources said. The student picked the suspect out of a photo lineup. His identity was not immediately released. A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration was not immediately able to provide any information about the arrest.VIA: NYP</td>\n",

Enjoy….David JHARSIYAH I have to say your analysis rings true as usual-the NYT continues its crusade against Trump while ignoring all evidence contrary their narrative about global warming/climate crisis. This time they even go so far out there claiming we can expect more hurricanes like Harvey because our planet s getting warmer due entirely man made CO2 emissions! What an absolute joke!! We need real journalism not propaganda at these times when people really do care if America survives or dies under Obama &amp; Co..This story was originally published August 28th 2017    and updated September 1st 2018     Read More Stories By Brandon Turbeville Follow @BrandonTurbo Read Other Articles From Forbes Magazine Here Are Some Related Posts To Help You Understand Global Warming Better...READ MORE GLOBAL WARMING NEWS HERESUPERCHARGE YOUR BRAIN WITH THESE TOP STORIES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM FORBIS MAGAZINE READ ALL OF OUR GREEN ISSUED ARTICLES BELOW...CLICK ON THIS LINK TO GET A FULL YEAR'S SUPPORTShip Now Login Or Register As An Individual For FREE Daily News Updates Subscribe Today!!!

debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.    \n",

First, you will see a background section that is in 2-D and not 3-D, like a projected image on a wall would look. Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be? Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology, and in this case, poorly done green screen.\\nStart watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking: \\nAnother salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren’t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it’s nothing more than green screen. CNN did it here, here, and also here.\\nTHE HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA EXPOSES THE LIE: Look in the viewfinder of the video camera filming Crooked Hillary – it’s black behind her yet in the official video it’s filled with people. Hmm…awake yet, America?\\n\\nLastly, if you look close at the end of the video, you will see the real people behind her with cameras, but then the main group of people behind them are flattened out in 2-D because they are not actually there.\\nHILLARY’S RALLY WAS UBER-TINY SO IT’S LITTLE WONDER THEY HAD TO RESORT TO GREEN SCREEN: Clinton supporters beginning to enter Broward College for Hillary Clinton early voting rally in Coconut Creek #tcpalm pic.twitter.com/8HhLkFltks \\n— Eric Hasert (@TCPalmHasert) October 25, 2016 \\n\\n   \n",

  BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.    \n",

The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.    \n",

The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   \n",

In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially. He s part of writing those checks so I could be back on the wealthy side again,  said Foreman. -Daily WireFox and Friends   Shortly after his inauguration, George Foreman offered some wise words of advice for his friend Donald J.

                                    The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.    \n",

third term and he s not about to let some geriatric socialist screw that up for him The Democrats true, Hillary-loving, stacking the deck, anti-democracy colors came through loud and clear today when

@JoeBiden for their impartiality #voanews pic.twitter.com/Qyk72eg7ja  The Voice of America (@VOANews) June 9, 2016Just a few hours later, Barack Obama decided he couldn t wait a week until Sanders

attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images   \n",

just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail)    \n",
       "Obama pledges faster action on new icebreakers to keep up in Arctic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”   \n",
       "If anyone doubts Bernie Sanders would've crushed Trump, show them this                                                                                         Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”   \n",

Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?    \n",

Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”   \n",

Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.    \n",

The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term.    \n",

This TSA agent took advantage of this young girl who was probably scared to death. Horrible!A college student was sexually molested at LaGuardia Airport by a uniformed TSA agent who demanded she go into a bathroom with him after she got off a flight so she could be searched, sources told The Post.The 22-year-old victim, who is Korean, had gotten off the plane from Salt Lake City around 8 p.m. Tuesday when the agent approached her on the third floor of Terminal B. He  lured  her into the bathroom by demanding she be searched and then molested her, the sources said. The woman filed a complaint with cops, and witnesses at a money exchange booth were able to help identify the sex fiend. The alleged assailant   a 5-foot-9, heavyset man wearing a TSA uniform   has been arrested and charged with sexual abuse, the sources said. The student picked the suspect out of a photo lineup. His identity was not immediately released. A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration was not immediately able to provide any information about the arrest.VIA: NYP   \n",

Here s why sleeping soundly should really top everyone's list right now...1) It helps reduce anxiety levels Anxiety disorders affect millions worldwide according some estimates affecting approximately 40 million adults aged 18 years old above In fact research shows those who suffer insomnia symptoms were twice likely than others without such problems had an increased risk factor associated specifically related directly linked depression.2 ) Improves memory & concentration Memory loss affects nearly 50% percent older Americans age 65+ while Alzheimer disease accounts roughly 5 %of deaths among seniors Over half(54%) reported having trouble concentrating during daily activities due primarily because lack sufficient restful slumber 3).

This article has been edited for length but retains all of its content including references where appropriate    (see end) [1] A new study released today shows a dramatic increase over time since 2000-01 levels on both sides – up nearly 50% among Republicans; more than 30 % higher amongst Democrats compared with 2001/02 figures[2]. In addition there are some interesting differences between men's voting patterns versus women s - which we will discuss later... But first let us look briefly into what these findings mean....In summary:- There have not onlybeen significant changes within each party as well an overall shift towards right wing politics across most parties.- These shifts appear likely due primarily because voters who were previously undecided or leaning left now lean significantly further Rightward while those already inclined Leftwards remain so unchanged.[3][4]\"This analysis suggests two things,\" says Professor Richard Hillman, coauthor \"First it indicates how important swing voter behaviour may become going forward if current trends continue.\" Second he adds:\"It also points out just why political strategists should pay close attention when they see signs their target audience appears less willing either ideologically committed toward one side OR even open minded enough about changing allegiance\"Dr James Dornan author comments : \"\"These results suggest something very different happening politically around Australia during recent years\", said Associate Professors Jim Druckenmiller & Andrew Leigh.(See below video clip ) We believe our data supports other research showing Australians becoming increasingly conservative under Obama like policies such      as Obamacare     and increased regulation affecting business growth https://youtu?v=_Xr0l7tKx8cM&feature = relatedWe encourage readers interested learning much deeper insights regarding Australian election polling methods please visit http:/www._electionpollingmethodology _com/.

The NHS has been under attack from both sides since it was created by Winston Churchill’ s Labour government after World War II as part an effort at social reform that included nationalized industries like electricity generation. In recent years however, attacks on this institution have come not only through political rhetoric but also with real cuts made over several decades which are now being accelerated due largely because Britain's economy continues struggling even though they were supposed be outgrowing recession last year    and despite record levels unemployment among young people who will soon enter into full-time employment if there ever would'vebeen jobs available when many had just left school having no prospects whatsoever...the so called \"recovery\" we're supposedly experiencing isn't really anything more than smoke & mirrors designed simply keep us distracted while our country sinks deeper down debt hole every day....a situation exacerbated further still today thanks primarily too Wall Street banks whose reckless speculation caused 2008 financial crisis yet continue reaping huge profits off taxpayer bailouts meant intended solely help ordinary Americans get back onto solid footing again; meanwhile those same bankers remain virtually untouched themselves except perhaps via fines paid heretofore rather then actually losing any assets held offshore where little can possibly happen legally against them anyway!In spite everything else going wrong politically these days including Brexit uncertainty plus Trumpism/Brexit together threatening global peace itself what makes things worse about British politics right? Well firstly you might say given how much power London holds within EU decision making process especially considering UK membership status alone grants nation veto rights regarding major policy changes affecting other member states unless overridden unanimously otherwise known colloquially referred t0 'block voting' ; secondly Britains own parliament seems incapable nor interested enough anymore either bowing instead merely following orders issued directly form Brussels bureaucrats without question thus undermining democratic principles inherent therein  \n",

By Dr David Heber, MD | October 1st 2016 Share Tweet Pin It The benefits to your health from getting enough sleep are numerous – but did you know that there is also an unexpected benefit? A good night's rest can help with weight loss too… Here at the Center For Advanced Medicine we believe it all starts by eating right (and not just before bedtime), exercising regularly during daylight hours only when possible or if necessary using light therapy lamps like our Light Boxes which mimic natural sunlight; avoiding blue lights after sunset as they suppress melatonin production needed so important throughout life stages including pregnancy & menopause...but what about sleeping well each evening?? We have found this article very interesting because while most people think “sleep aids\" such drugs will make them sleepy - these researchers discovered something quite different....they actually increase metabolism AND burn calories!! This could be huge news especially since many Americans suffer insomnia due primarily stress related issues. If nothing else try some relaxation techniques prior going down into dreamland tonight...you may find yourself waking up feeling refreshed tomorrow morning instead..DrDavidHebert@gmailcom Page Views : 52655 Previous Post Next Posts Related Topics To Top 10 Articles About Natural Remedies Is There Such Thing As Too Much Vitamin D?

In fact it has been reported that in some cases up to 80% of all government spending goes directly into debt service payments for existing obligations rather than being used productively or efficiently towards new investments which would create jobs today!

It Can Make Us More Prone To Cancer And Other Diseases…In addition being linked directly into cancer development there appears another way insufficient amounts affect those already diagnosed but still fighting their illness....the immune system becomes compromised making them less able fight off infections during treatment thus reducing chances they will survive long term….and even if someone does beat back malignancy after surgery then inadequate recovery time spent asleep makes recurrence much higher than normal so patients must take extra precautions against reoccurring tumors later down road because without sufficient hours under cover most people cannot heal themselves fully once again If these findings aren t alarming yet consider further research showing links between short periods slept per day versus longer ones where survival rates were found significantly better among women suffering breast cancers especially since studies show menopausal females tend toward shorter sleeps anyway So here s something else worth noting regarding increased risks related specifically only female hormones involved Women undergoing hormone replacement therapy had lower odds overall surviving five years post diagnosis compared [with] nonusers …women receiving estrogen alone did  \n",

       "      <td>(Reuters) - An estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.</td>\n",

Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology, and in this case, poorly done green screen.\\nStart watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking: \\nAnother salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren’t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it’s nothing more than green screen. CNN did it here, here, and also here.\\nTHE HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA EXPOSES THE LIE: Look in the viewfinder of the video camera filming Crooked Hillary – it’s black behind her yet in the official video it’s filled with people.

       "      <td>BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday vowed to file an impeachment complaint against the head of the country s anti-graft body after she launched an inquiry into allegations that he has billions of pesos in undeclared funds in bank accounts. The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Republican Party is not well   we know it and they know it.After getting roasted in the last general election, the Republican Party conducted a fittingly named  autopsy  on what would need to change before 2016 in order for the party to successfully compete with Democrats. The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</td>\n",
       "      <td>The RNC has supposedly devised an election plan that nearly assured the public that they would elect either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. In other words, it looks like the Democratic Party will have to go along with the Obama plan without any presumptive Republican support from Republicans. In fact, according to this DNC poll conducted by Wikileaks, only 3 percent of Americans said they would vote for Trump.gly.gly.ca/npcw3rH2Z8K Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGriffianni) October 31, 2016gly.ca/npcw5D4Utullah1 Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Follow Us on Twitter!guiltynewspolitah1 Mail with questions or comments about this site. \"Godlike Productions\" &amp; \"Courtesy\" are registered trademarks of Zero Point Ltd.

The intolerant left simply won t allow it Boxing legend George Foreman has had about enough of the disrespect of the United States he s seeing in some professional athletes, particularly Colin Kaepernick and Kevin Durant.In an interview on the Offended America Podcast on Monday, the 68-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion blasted the national anthem protests and shunning of the White House by the likes of Kaepernick and Durant, suggesting they were born out of ignorance about just how privileged we are to live in this great country.As for Durant s announcement that he would not attend the White House if his Golden State Warriors are invited because he doesn t  respect who s in office right now,  Foreman said he and the others protesting Trump were just  sore losers. In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially.

       "      <td>The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump has been in office for several months now, and he still hasn t figured out the proper way to respond to a terrorist attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump.

       "      <td>President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”</td>\n",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       "      <th>NASA and FEMA Rehearse for the Unthinkable: An Asteroid Strike on Los Angeles - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Imagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles. The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”</td>\n",

First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?</td>\n",

       "      <th>‘Not Our President’: Protests Spread After Donald Trump’s Election - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Thousands of people across the country marched, shut down highways, burned effigies and shouted angry slogans on Wednesday night to protest the election of Donald J. Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”</td>\n",

       "      <th>Trump has been playing a part, will become more presidential: adviser</th>\n",
       "      <td>HOLLYWOOD, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top advisers to Donald Trump assured Republican Party leaders on Thursday that the New York billionaire would adopt a more presidential demeanor soon, to temper the image projected during his campaign so far. Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Czech election winner Babis to seek minority government</th>\n",
       "      <td>LANY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Czech election winner Andrej Babis will attempt to form a minority government after being shunned by other parties, Babis said on Tuesday after meeting the president. The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said.

debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.    \n",

First, you will see a background section that is in 2-D and not 3-D, like a projected image on a wall would look. Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be? Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology, and in this case, poorly done green screen.\\nStart watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking: \\nAnother salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren’t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it’s nothing more than green screen. CNN did it here, here, and also here.\\nTHE HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA EXPOSES THE LIE: Look in the viewfinder of the video camera filming Crooked Hillary – it’s black behind her yet in the official video it’s filled with people. Hmm…awake yet, America?\\n\\nLastly, if you look close at the end of the video, you will see the real people behind her with cameras, but then the main group of people behind them are flattened out in 2-D because they are not actually there.\\nHILLARY’S RALLY WAS UBER-TINY SO IT’S LITTLE WONDER THEY HAD TO RESORT TO GREEN SCREEN: Clinton supporters beginning to enter Broward College for Hillary Clinton early voting rally in Coconut Creek #tcpalm pic.twitter.com/8HhLkFltks \\n— Eric Hasert (@TCPalmHasert) October 25, 2016 \\n\\n   \n",

  BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.    \n",

The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.    \n",

The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   \n",

The intolerant left simply won t allow it Boxing legend George Foreman has had about enough of the disrespect of the United States he s seeing in some professional athletes, particularly Colin Kaepernick and Kevin Durant.In an interview on the Offended America Podcast on Monday, the 68-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion blasted the national anthem protests and shunning of the White House by the likes of Kaepernick and Durant, suggesting they were born out of ignorance about just how privileged we are to live in this great country.As for Durant s announcement that he would not attend the White House if his Golden State Warriors are invited because he doesn t  respect who s in office right now,  Foreman said he and the others protesting Trump were just  sore losers. In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially. He s part of writing those checks so I could be back on the wealthy side again,  said Foreman. -Daily WireFox and Friends   Shortly after his inauguration, George Foreman offered some wise words of advice for his friend Donald J.

                                    The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.    \n",

third term and he s not about to let some geriatric socialist screw that up for him The Democrats true, Hillary-loving, stacking the deck, anti-democracy colors came through loud and clear today when

@JoeBiden for their impartiality #voanews pic.twitter.com/Qyk72eg7ja  The Voice of America (@VOANews) June 9, 2016Just a few hours later, Barack Obama decided he couldn t wait a week until Sanders

attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images   \n",

just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail)    \n",
       "Obama pledges faster action on new icebreakers to keep up in Arctic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”   \n",
       "If anyone doubts Bernie Sanders would've crushed Trump, show them this                                                                                         Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”   \n",

Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?    \n",

Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”   \n",

Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.    \n",

The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term.    \n",

This TSA agent took advantage of this young girl who was probably scared to death. Horrible!A college student was sexually molested at LaGuardia Airport by a uniformed TSA agent who demanded she go into a bathroom with him after she got off a flight so she could be searched, sources told The Post.The 22-year-old victim, who is Korean, had gotten off the plane from Salt Lake City around 8 p.m. Tuesday when the agent approached her on the third floor of Terminal B. He  lured  her into the bathroom by demanding she be searched and then molested her, the sources said. The woman filed a complaint with cops, and witnesses at a money exchange booth were able to help identify the sex fiend. The alleged assailant   a 5-foot-9, heavyset man wearing a TSA uniform   has been arrested and charged with sexual abuse, the sources said. The student picked the suspect out of a photo lineup. His identity was not immediately released. A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration was not immediately able to provide any information about the arrest.VIA: NYP   \n",

According to Twitter users who tracked down the event on the green screen, “Hillary Clinton had an extremely disappointing day.” With only 45,000 people out of the 10,000 mark today, it is impossible for anyone with a green screen to see what’s going on. Even worse, 63 percent of the women who showed up in the polls didn’t even look like they were wearing blue or red...acial...atal....

In other words, it looks like the Democratic Party will have to go along with the Obama plan without any presumptive Republican support from Republicans. In fact, according to this DNC poll conducted by Wikileaks, only 3 percent of Americans said they would vote for Trump.gly.gly.ca/npcw3rH2Z8K Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGriffianni) October 31, 2016gly.ca/npcw5D4Utullah1 Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Follow Us on Twitter!guiltynewspolitah1 Mail with questions or comments about this site. \"Godlike Productions\" & \"Courtesy\" are registered trademarks of Zero Point Ltd.

In his report, Mike Browne, an ex-Navy SEAL who was arrested during the raid on the Port Arthur complex in West Texas, stated that officers were not allowed to question anyone while they were out patrolling the area. He also claimed that one of the primary reasons for violating police law is because they treat civilians with respect and dignity. What else can be said about this unbelievable interrogation?

In addition to being horrifically insulting Hillary, there were numerous other disturbing moments of violence and bloodshed that took place during the election. These were not your typical Clinton-era protests but rather examples of how the political class has taken over Washington. In some cases, these violent protests may even have been inspired by the very real possibility that President-elect Trump might be running for president.

       "      <td>(Reuters) - An estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.</td>\n",

First, you will see a background section that is in 2-D and not 3-D, like a projected image on a wall would look. Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be?

       "      <td>BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Philippines' Duterte takes aim at graft agency head for query on his wealth</th>\n",
       "      <td>MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday vowed to file an impeachment complaint against the head of the country s anti-graft body after she launched an inquiry into allegations that he has billions of pesos in undeclared funds in bank accounts. The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.</td>\n",

       "      <th>RNC’s Hilariously Delusional Election Model Predicts Obama Might Vote Trump</th>\n",
       "      <td>The Republican Party is not well   we know it and they know it.After getting roasted in the last general election, the Republican Party conducted a fittingly named  autopsy  on what would need to change before 2016 in order for the party to successfully compete with Democrats. The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</td>\n",

The intolerant left simply won t allow it Boxing legend George Foreman has had about enough of the disrespect of the United States he s seeing in some professional athletes, particularly Colin Kaepernick and Kevin Durant.In an interview on the Offended America Podcast on Monday, the 68-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion blasted the national anthem protests and shunning of the White House by the likes of Kaepernick and Durant, suggesting they were born out of ignorance about just how privileged we are to live in this great country.As for Durant s announcement that he would not attend the White House if his Golden State Warriors are invited because he doesn t  respect who s in office right now,  Foreman said he and the others protesting Trump were just  sore losers. In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially. He s part of writing those checks so I could be back on the wealthy side again,  said Foreman. -Daily WireFox and Friends   Shortly after his inauguration, George Foreman offered some wise words of advice for his friend Donald J.

       "      <td>The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump has been in office for several months now, and he still hasn t figured out the proper way to respond to a terrorist attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Donald Trump s pick for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, has withdrawn from the nomination just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail)</td>\n",

       "      <th>Obama pledges faster action on new icebreakers to keep up in Arctic</th>\n",
       "      <td>President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”</td>\n",

       "      <th>If anyone doubts Bernie Sanders would've crushed Trump, show them this</th>\n",
       "      <td>Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       "      <th>NASA and FEMA Rehearse for the Unthinkable: An Asteroid Strike on Los Angeles - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Imagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles. The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Comments Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?</td>\n",

       "      <th>‘Not Our President’: Protests Spread After Donald Trump’s Election - The New York Times</th>\n",
       "      <td>Thousands of people across the country marched, shut down highways, burned effigies and shouted angry slogans on Wednesday night to protest the election of Donald J. Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”</td>\n",

       "      <th>Trump has been playing a part, will become more presidential: adviser</th>\n",
       "      <td>HOLLYWOOD, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top advisers to Donald Trump assured Republican Party leaders on Thursday that the New York billionaire would adopt a more presidential demeanor soon, to temper the image projected during his campaign so far. Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Czech election winner Babis to seek minority government</th>\n",
       "      <td>LANY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Czech election winner Andrej Babis will attempt to form a minority government after being shunned by other parties, Babis said on Tuesday after meeting the president. The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term.</td>\n",

debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday night’s debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last week’s second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular “Sunday Night Football,” was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesday’s audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.    \n",

First, you will see a background section that is in 2-D and not 3-D, like a projected image on a wall would look. Secondly, you see when anyone steps in front of that background, there appears a darkened halo around them. Why would that be? Well, that happens in what we call green screen technology, and in this case, poorly done green screen.\\nStart watching at the 1:03:00 mark to see where Crooked Hillary starts speaking: \\nAnother salient clue that she used a green screen is that when she turns around to wave to these people, they are mere feet away and yet she shakes hands with none of them. Why, because they weren’t there. Liberal news rag CNN is infamous for pretending to be in a location but in reality it’s nothing more than green screen.

                                                                                                                                                                                                           BERLIN (Reuters) - If the United States terminates the Iran nuclear deal or reimposes sanctions on Tehran it could result in Iran developing nuclear weapons and raise the danger of war close to Europe, Germany’s foreign minister said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump refused on Friday to formally certify that Tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is. He warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Deutschlandfunk radio that Trump had sent a “difficult and dangerous signal” when the U.S. administration was also dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. “My big concern is that what is happening in Iran or with Iran from the U.S. perspective will not remain an Iranian issue but many others in the world will consider whether they themselves should acquire nuclear weapons too given that such agreements are being destroyed,” Gabriel said. “And then our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world,” he said. He said if the United States terminated the deal or if sanctions were reimposed on Tehran, it would give Iranian hardliners, who are against negotiations with the West, the upper hand. “Then they might revert to developing nuclear weapons,” Gabriel said, adding Israel would not tolerate that and “then we will be back where we were 10, 12 years ago with the danger of war relatively close to Europe”. He urged the United States not to endanger the security of its allies and its own people for domestic policy reasons. Hailed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal was also signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. European allies have warned of a split with Washington over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo undermines U.S. credibility abroad. Trump has given the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2016.    \n",

The firebrand leader said he also wanted the chief justice of the Supreme Court removed because she allowed herself to be used as a tool by his political opponents, who are conspiring to unseat him.  We will file an impeachment case against her,  Duterte told reporters, referring to Conchita Carpio-Morales, who heads the Office of the Ombudsman, the government s anti-graft agency.  I would tend to believe she was part of the conspiracy.  Duterte was angered when the agency confirmed last month it was examining allegations that he failed to disclose the full extent of his wealth in a mandatory asset declaration when he was mayor of a southern city prior to becoming president.   In the end, they will discover, to their sorrow, there is no such amount,  he said, challenging Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to join him in making public their own bank accounts and resigning from office. He said Sereno did not disclose government earnings of 30 million pesos ($588,000) for serving as a private lawyer in an airport arbitration case. Sereno already faces a pending impeachment case in Congress. Sereno made no immediate comment, but her lawyers said they were ready to answer the complaint and prove she had not committed an impeachable offense. An impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales, who is the aunt of Duterte s son-in-law, would be based on accusations of  selective justice  and the use of  falsified documents , the president added.  Carpio-Morales  office did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. In an earlier statement, her office had said,  This office shall not be intimidated. We will nonetheless proceed with the probe as mandated by the constitution.      In the Philippines, the president, vice president, supreme court judges, heads of constitutional agencies and the ombudsman can only be removed through impeachment on the basis of high crimes such as treason, bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and constitutional violations. Duterte said the two women had conspired with members of the Liberal Party and with his critic, Senator Antonio Trillanes, who supplied the ombudsman with what he called illegally-acquired and stolen bank records. In an interview with reporters, Trillanes denied the president s latest allegations.  For me, Mr Duterte, do not avoid the issue of hidden wealth with this malicious allegation,  he added. The Liberal Party made no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.    \n",

The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   \n",

In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially.

                                    The owner of the Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones will receive an ethical violation warning for providing game tickets, airfare, and hotel reservations to over 100 police officers. [Jones argued in front of a North Little Rock, Arkansas, city council commission that his gift, valued at approximately $300, 000, was a tribute to his home town’s police officers. Jones said that the gifts were not payment for ordinary work performed by police, but to “send a positive message of the work police do outside of their normal jobs,” reported ArkansasMatters. com.  Arkansas state law does not allow public servants to receive gifts of over $100. Internet blogger Russ Racop exposed the first time violation and has come under fire for his criticism of the goodwill extended to the men and women in blue. As it turns out, Racop has been outed with having his own set of issues with the court system, reported the Arkansas Times. Former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel is offering free legal services to any of the officers who received the gift. However, according to the Times, Little Rock has no intention of treating the gifts as taxable income.  Fortunately for Jones, a first violation of the law is considered a minor offense, subject only to a warning.  Next time Jerry can just send his money to Black Lives Matters, where he will avoid admonition and probably relieve a hardy round of applause.    \n",

third term and he s not about to let some geriatric socialist screw that up for him The Democrats true, Hillary-loving, stacking the deck, anti-democracy colors came through loud and clear today when

attack. Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images   \n",

just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the Senate HELP committee.Puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous.  He officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, did on The Oprah Winfrey Show came to light.  She claimed that she had to flee from her, then husband, and that she had been abused by Puzder during their marriage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cURHgCbSWOcFierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce.  She has also sent a letter to the Senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.Puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me.  Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017(Source: Daily Mail)    \n",
       "Obama pledges faster action on new icebreakers to keep up in Arctic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard, in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmer.\\n\\nThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdated.\\n\\nThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders — including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest state’s 6,640-mile coastline.\\n\\nThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations, especially Russia, which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 more.\\n\\nThe White House said that after World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet — four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard. Today, the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers, and just one is a heavy-duty icebreaker.\\n\\nThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022.\\n\\nThe announcements Monday night — after the president’s speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations — were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctic’s largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. In 2014, the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern Quebec.\\n\\nEven if the United States does not permit large-scale mining or exploration in Alaska, the state’s shores could be threatened by spills, leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nations.\\n\\n“The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,” the White House said in a statement. “Accordingly, meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for year-round access to greater expanses within polar regions.”\\n\\nAlaska’s leaders said Obama’s announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up. Murkowski said the $4 million in last year’s federal budget “doesn’t even buy you a porthole.” The current budget includes $8 million, she said.\\n\\n“Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes,” Murkowski said.\\n\\nThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration. Sullivan, a freshman senator, said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5,000-member Arctic combat brigades.\\n\\nSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a much-discussed pipeline for natural gas, which can be liquefied and shipped to China or Japan.\\n\\nSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state. And Gov. Bill Walker, a longtime Republican who won election as an independent, has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate change.\\n\\n[Obama can rename Mount McKinley Denali — but he can’t stop its loss of ice]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited the Exit Glacier, which has receded 1.25 miles since 1815 — 187 feet last year alone. “This is as good of a signpost of what we’re dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything,” the president said.\\n\\nStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed, he said that when glaciers melt, the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels, altering the surrounding flora and fauna.\\n\\n“It is spectacular, though,” he said. “We want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.”\\n\\nHe said his hike “beats being in the office.”\\n\\nObama’s announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate change.\\n\\nIn his speech, he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures, melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop, and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgency.\\n\\n“The point is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now,” he said.\\n\\n“Our understanding of climate change advances each day,” he added. “The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present.”\\n\\nObama did not, however, put forward any major new plans on the climate front, whether for Alaska or for world leaders. That disappointed Murkowski.\\n\\n“What do we do, and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska?” she asked after the speech. “What specifics do you have? We didn’t hear that. We just heard a call to action.”\\n\\nBut it was a rousing call to action. Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change, saying that they are “on their own shrinking island.”\\n\\nHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economies.\\n\\n“The notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that’s an argument oftentimes for inaction,” he said. “The irony, of course . . . is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change.”\\n\\nHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends. Among the results, he said: “Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing. . . . Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own.”\\n\\nThe president warned, “We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.”   \n",
       "If anyone doubts Bernie Sanders would've crushed Trump, show them this                                                                                         Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism.

The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”   \n",

Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?    \n",

Trump as president. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful. Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston Chicago Portland, Ore. Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In Oakland alone, the Police Department said, the crowd grew from about 3, 000 people at 7 p. m. to 6, 000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, with SFGate. com reporting that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, according to other local news reports. It was the second night of protests there, following unruly demonstrations that led to property damage and left at least one person injured shortly after Mr. Trump’s election was announced. The protests on Wednesday came just hours after Hillary Clinton, in her concession speech, asked supporters to give Mr. Trump a “chance to lead. ” One of the biggest demonstrations was in Los Angeles, where protesters burned a Trump effigy at City Hall and shut down a section of Highway 101. Law enforcement officials were called out to disperse the hundreds of people who swarmed across the multilane freeway. In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the   lives. They chanted “Not our president” and “New York hates Trump” and carried signs that said, among other things, “Dump Trump. ” Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators. The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown. Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection. Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd. “I came here because people came out to protest the racism that he’s promoting,” he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. “I’m not scared for myself personally. What I’m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families. ” Protesters with umbrellas beat a piñata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building. The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested. Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump’s election as something that was “not supposed to happen. ” “We’re living in a country that’s supposed to be united, a melting pot,” she said. “It’s exposing all these underground racists and sexists. ” Elsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results. After Mr. Trump’s victory speech, more than 2, 000 students at the University of California, Los Angeles, marched through the streets of the campus’s Westwood neighborhood. There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara Temple University, in Philadelphia and the University of Massachusetts. High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities. As U. C. L. A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier. “I’m more than a little nervous about the future,” said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. “We all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There’s a whole new reality out there for us now. ” Chuy Fernandez, a   economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers. “I’m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,” Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally. “We’re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen. ” On Facebook, a page titled “Not My President” called for protesters to gather on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, in the nation’s capital. “We refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,” the organizers wrote. “We have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won’t stand for his ideologies. ”   \n",

Trump’s representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. “The part that he’s been playing is now evolving into the part that you’ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change,” Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been “projecting an image” to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on “crooked Hillary,” the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. “You’ll see a different guy,” said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. “I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a “rigged” system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trump’s advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manafort’s comments show that Trump’s campaign style “is just an act.” Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trump’s envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the party’s electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a “more presidential demeanor” over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that “we talked about how we’re going to expand the map.” As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: “We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump.” Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should “stop fighting among ourselves” and unite behind Trump. “I don’t think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives don’t consolidate,” he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trump’s campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC “Today” show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was “paying a big price” because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.    \n",

The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term.    \n",

This TSA agent took advantage of this young girl who was probably scared to death. Horrible!A college student was sexually molested at LaGuardia Airport by a uniformed TSA agent who demanded she go into a bathroom with him after she got off a flight so she could be searched, sources told The Post.The 22-year-old victim, who is Korean, had gotten off the plane from Salt Lake City around 8 p.m. Tuesday when the agent approached her on the third floor of Terminal B. He  lured  her into the bathroom by demanding she be searched and then molested her, the sources said. The woman filed a complaint with cops, and witnesses at a money exchange booth were able to help identify the sex fiend. The alleged assailant   a 5-foot-9, heavyset man wearing a TSA uniform   has been arrested and charged with sexual abuse, the sources said. The student picked the suspect out of a photo lineup. His identity was not immediately released. A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration was not immediately able to provide any information about the arrest.VIA: NYP   \n",
